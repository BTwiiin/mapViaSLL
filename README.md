# mapViaSLL
This is a STL map re-creation in C++ , but this map is implemented using a sinlge linked list, so several methods might have increased or decreased complexity of the algorithm. Also some of the methods are missing. In this specific example map is called dictionary.
Some methods that are missing in dictionary: .count(), .size(), .swap(), .max_size(), .at and const_reference_iterators.
